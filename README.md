# Shooter Game using PyGame with Python Programming Language
This is the mid-term project of the Virtual Reality and Game Development course and I worked it on with two of my friends. In this project, we created a Shooter Game with the help of the PyGame library using Python programming language. 

In our game, we created three different levels for the user, and there is also an enemy in every level that the shooter needs to fight in order to go to the next level. In order to control the shooter's movement, we use the keyboard button such as:
- The "A" or "Left Arrow" buttons are used to move left
- The "D" or "Right Arrow" buttons are used to move right
- The "W" or "Up Arrow" buttons are used to jump
- The "R" or "Space" buttons are used to shoot
- The "Q" button is used to throw the grenade

For more detail on what our game looks like, you may download and run our code and for detail on how we made the game program, you may check the documentation that we attached in the code. If you want to get the full assets and audio for the game along with the code (Main.py), you can download the MID_ShooterGame_PyGame.zip file.
